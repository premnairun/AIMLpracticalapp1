# Professional certification in ML&amp;AIModule 5: Practical Application 1

## Overview

This practical application assignment of the program will seek to answer the question, “Will a customer accept the coupon?” The goal of this project is to use visualizations and probability distributions learned in the program to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those who did not. 

## Data

The data is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, and passenger, and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. There are three possible answers people can choose from:

    “Right away”
    
    “Later, before the coupon expires”
    
    “No, I do not want the coupon”

The first two responses are labeled as “Y = 1,” and the third is labeled as “Y = 0.” There are five different types of coupons: Less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carryout and takeaway, bars, and more expensive restaurants ($20–$50).

## Deliverables

Final submission will include the Jupyter Notebook and other relevant files, such as the dataset provided. Data is explored utilising the knowledge of pandas and Python to create statistical summaries demonstrating differences in those who accepted and rejected the coupon. The Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to create a visualization using Python are utilised. 


# Solutioning

    Part 1 : Data Loading and Cleansing
    
    Part 2 : Data Conversion and Grouping
    
    Part 3 : Analysing and Calculating
    
    Part 4 : Visualisation

    Part 5 : Conclusion and further recommendations
    
## Wrap-Up:
## Influnce of Age:
Customers under the age of 30 accepted coupons and offeres which will encourage them to visit and use the facilities more.

## Number of  Visits per month:
Frequent visitors who visited the bars and restaurants more than once a month will accept coupons more and use the offers. 

## Spending Habits:
Lower income customers who frequent restaurants will accept more coupons.

These analysis will lead us to predict young and frequent visiting custoimers will accept coupons more and will use the facilities more.

## Future Recommendations

    >    Further analisis recomended with marital status and distance travelled data.
    
    >    Run analsis the coupon acceptance rate based on distance between the drivers and location where the coupon can be used
    
    >    Analyse more on different type and maount of coupons accepted etc.
