# Professional certification in ML&amp;AIModule 5: Practical Application 1

## Overview

This practical application assignment of the program will seek to answer the question, “Will a customer accept the coupon?” The goal of this project is to use visualizations and probability distributions learned in the program to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those who did not. 

## Data

The data is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, and passenger, and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. There are three possible answers people can choose from:

    “Right away”
    
    “Later, before the coupon expires”
    
    “No, I do not want the coupon”

The first two responses are labeled as “Y = 1,” and the third is labeled as “Y = 0.” There are five different types of coupons: Less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carryout and takeaway, bars, and more expensive restaurants ($20–$50).

## Deliverables

Final submission will include the 'Practical Application 1 Jupyter Notebook' and other relevant files, such as the dataset provided. Data is explored utilising the knowledge of pandas and Python to create statistical summaries demonstrating differences in those who accepted and rejected the coupon. The Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to create a visualization using Python are utilised.
